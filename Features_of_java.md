Automatic memory allocation
2. Object Oriented
Java follows OOP principles:
Encapsulation – Binding data and methods
Inheritance – Acquiring properties of parent class
Polymorphism – One method, many forms
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details
3. Platform Independent
Uses bytecode
JVM converts bytecode to machine code
4. Secure
No direct memory access
Bytecode verifier
Class loader security
5. Robust
Exception handling
Garbage collection
Strong type checking
6. Multithreaded
Thread class and Runnable interface
Used in servers and games
7. High Performance
JIT compiler converts bytecode to native code
8. Distributed
